A. I used the skeleton code that Sadie created to add the functionality to use real wikilinks vs some pre-defined
relationships she had previously made. I implemented the BFS in WikiLadder.cpp that finds the shortest path 
between wiki pages. I also made it so that the program accepts user input for the links, and having it so that it 
interacts with the Page and Wikiladder objects.

B. Sadie created somewhat of a skeleton code that had the basic setup for this assignment and she also 
created the linter and Google Tests. She also helped me with some bug fixes along the way of course :)

C. I feel like this class really instilled the principles of OOP for me. I had taken classes on it in the past, but 
never understood it to the level I do now. I also feel much more comfortable with C++ in general, as I never grasped it
in a class I took at a previous school. 

D. I think this course was run very well. The assignments covered varieties of topics and introduced several skills I did 
not think I would I learn in this class. I like the assignment/lab structure and appreciate the extra credit opportunities 
I was given.
