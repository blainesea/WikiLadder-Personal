Summary about Linter:
-We decided to use cpplint as a Linter. This is a C++ style checker, 
to analyze my code for potential issues and ensure it followed best 
practices based on Googleâ€™s C++ Style Guide. After installing cpplint 
using pip, we ran it on our main project files main.cpp, Page.cpp, and 
WikiLadder.cpp to identify and fix style issues like inconsistent 
formatting and missing comments. Using cpplint helped improve the 
overall readability and maintainability of my code.
